                    <h3>Multimedia Technology</h3>
                    <p>
                        Multimedia is content that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, 
                        video and interactive content. Multimedia contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such 
                        as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material.

                        Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by information content processing
                         devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance. Multimedia 
                         devices are electronic media devices used to store and experience multimedia content. Multimedia is 
                         distinguished from mixed media in fine art; for example, by including audio it has a broader scope. In the 
                         early years of multimedia the term "rich media" was synonymous with interactive multimedia, and "hypermedia" 
                         was an application of multimedia.
